Hardware Library for the 1.1‚Äù E-Paper display (EPD) from Plastic Logic for Adafruits GFX library. 

Documentation
--------------
This is the place to get started with your new hardware! ;-) We have divided the documentation into the following sections:
* **[Hookup Guide](https://robpo.github.io/Paperino/)** - Step-by-step instructions to get your Paperino setup and run within minutes.
* **[Examples](https://robpo.github.io/Paperino/exampleHelloWorld/)** - Ready to use examples for your own inspiration.
* **[Reference](https://github.com/RobPo/Paperino/tree/master/datasheets)** - Datasheets & Application Notes.

### So, what is Paperino?

Paperino is an easy to use micro EPD breakout-board for the Photon or other Arduino-compatible microcontrollers. The eInk-based ePaper display mimics the appearance of natural paper and is capable of holding text and images indefinitely, even without electricity. This makes Paperino perfect for your next battery-driven, connected project where the display content changes rarely.

Paperino also integrates an easy to use accelerometer. It extends the EPD by tap-sensing functions and offers portrait/landscape detection. Furthermore you can wake-up your MCU after movement-based events from deep-sleeping, saving battery live during waiting phases.
