Paperino PL_microEPD Arduino Library
===============================================================

Welcome to the Paperino docs! This is a Hardware Library for the 1.1” E-Paper display (EPD) from Plastic Logic for Adafruits GFX library.

### So, what is Paperino?

Paperino is an easy to use micro EPD breakout-board for the Photon or other Arduino-compatible microcontrollers. The eInk-based ePaper display mimics the appearance of natural paper and is capable of holding text and images indefinitely, even without electricity. This makes Paperino perfect for your next battery-driven, connected project where the display content changes rarely.

Paperino also integrates an easy to use accelerometer. It extends the EPD by tap-sensing functions and offers portrait/landscape detection. Furthermore you can wake-up your MCU after movement-based events from deep-sleeping, saving battery live during waiting phases.

Documentation
--------------
This is the place to get started with your new hardware! We have divided the documentation into the following sections:


* **[Hookup Guide](https://robpo.github.io/Paperino/)** - Step-by-step instructions to get your Paperino setup and run within minutes.
* **[Examples](https://robpo.github.io/Paperino/exampleHelloWorld/)** - Ready to use examples for your own inspiration.
* **[Reference](https://github.com/RobPo/Paperino/tree/gh-pages/datasheets)** - Datasheets & Application Notes.
* **[Hardware](https://github.com/RobPo/Paperino/tree/gh-pages/hardware)** - Schematics & PCB layouts.


How To Use
-------------------

### Installation

This library is part of the Particle and Arduino **Library Manager**. Please search for `PL_microEPD` within the Manager and download the library, that’s it! Included are six example sketches, they are useful to learn the basics about this ePaper screen.

### Hardware hookup

To start communicating with the ePaper driver IC, you’ll need to supply 3.3V and four more wires for SPI communication (@3.3V voltage level). Please have a look at the [hook-up guide](https://robpo.github.io/Paperino/) for more detailed information. 

### Example: Hello World!

This is the [first](https://robpo.github.io/Paperino/exampleHelloWorld/), and shortest possible demo and shows how to address the ePaper (don’t forget to update the GPIO name if needed in line 3):


```cpp
#include "Adafruit_GFX.h"
#include "PL_microEPD.h"

#define EPD_CS      A2
PL_microEPD display(EPD_CS);  

void setup() {  
    SPI.begin();                    
    SPI.beginTransaction(SPISettings(4000000, MSBFIRST, SPI_MODE0));
  
    display.begin();                
    display.print("Hello World!");
    display.update();               
}

void loop() {              
}
```

You should now be able to see the ePaper screen updating. Congratulation! If you feel more like a pro’ this is now the time to [add the wiring](https://robpo.github.io/Paperino/) of two more GPIO lines (called ‘busy’ & ‘reset’). They are needed to run the image updates a bit faster and/or to reset the IC after having it set to deep sleep.


### More…

Once this example is successfully running, please have a look at the following sketches: [GFX demo](https://robpo.github.io/Paperino/exampleGFXdemo/) shows how to draw all the letters, rectangles and dots. The [Graylevel](https://robpo.github.io/Paperino/example4GLs/) sketch explains how to use the four different graylevels in your next project. [Update modes](https://robpo.github.io/Paperino/exampleUpdateMode/) describes three different ways of updating an ePaper screen.
