Documentation
--------------
This is the place to get started with your new hardware! ;-) We have divided the documentation into the following sections:
* **[Hookup Guide](https://robpo.github.io/Paperino/)** - Step-by-step instructions to get your Paperino setup and run within minutes.
* **[Examples](https://robpo.github.io/Paperino/exampleHelloWorld/)** - Ready to use examples for your own inspiration.
* **[Reference](https://github.com/RobPo/Paperino/tree/gh-pages/datasheets)** - Datasheets & Application Notes.
* **[Hardware](https://github.com/RobPo/Paperino/tree/gh-pages/hardware)** - Schematics & PCB layouts.

### So, what is Paperino?

Paperino is an easy to use micro EPD breakout-board for the Photon or other Arduino-compatible microcontrollers. The eInk-based ePaper display mimics the appearance of natural paper and is capable of holding text and images indefinitely, even without electricity. This makes Paperino perfect for your next battery-driven, connected project where the display content changes rarely.

Paperino also integrates an easy to use accelerometer. It extends the EPD by tap-sensing functions and offers portrait/landscape detection. Furthermore you can wake-up your MCU after movement-based events from deep-sleeping, saving battery live during waiting phases.

Installation
-------------------
This library is part of the Particle and Arduino **Library Manager**. For easy installation please search for `PL_microEPD` within the Manager and download the library. Six example sketches are part of the package. Please start with them first to learn the basics about driving of this ePaper screen.

Distributors
-------------------
Paperino ePaper displays are available at [Crowd Supply](https://www.crowdsupply.com/robert-poser/paperino) and at [Watterott electronic](http://www.watterott.com/de/Paperino-A-micro-ePaper-with-accelerometer).
